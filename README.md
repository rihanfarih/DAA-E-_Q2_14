## Problem
elshe is a new student of informatics its 2020. because she had never previously studied offline at her campus, she was not familiar with the existing class schedule. One day she woke up late because she slept too late the night before

Therefore, help Elshe to choose the fastest path from where she lives (dormitory) to her class (informatics) from the map provided so that she is not late for her class.

## Analysis
We are using BFS  Algorithm to solve this. Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data  structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes  referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth  prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which instead explores the node  branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and expand other nodes. For example, depth n, before visit nodes in depth n+1.

#### Note
although the score is based on contributions on github, in this project we worked on it together and weren't too rigid about commits on github (commits are generally represented). therefore we hope the scores are distributed fairly among the three people.
