## Problem
Elshe is a new student of its 2020 informatics. because she had never previously studied offline at her campus, she was not familiar with the existing class schedule. One day she woke up late because she slept too late the night before

Therefore, help Elshe to choose the fastest path from where she lives (dormitory) to her class (informatics) from the map provided so that she is not late for her class.

## Analysis
#### Note
although the score is based on contributions on github, in this project we worked on it together and weren't too rigid about commits on github (commits are generally represented). therefore we hope the scores are distributed fairly among the three people.
